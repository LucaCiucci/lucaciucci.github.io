<h1>About Me</h1>

<div style="text-align: center">ðŸš§ Under construction ðŸš§</div>

<p>
    I'm a <strong>physics student</strong> and a <strong>software developer</strong>. My main interests are <strong>physics</strong> and <strong>programming</strong>. I'm interested in physics because I like to understand how the world works and in programming because I like to create things and I like to solve problems, learning new things as I go.
</p>
<p>
    I worked with many programming languages, especially <code>C++</code> and <code>Rust</code>.<br>
    I developed many projects in <code>C++</code>, including a <strong>Structured Light</strong> 3d Scanner, many mathematical algorithms and a total rewrite of the Qt <strong>Signal/Slot</strong> system. I also applied my <code>C++</code> knowledge to some embedded systems, working with <strong>ESP32</strong>, <strong>STM32</strong>, <strong>Raspberry</strong> and <strong>Arduino</strong> boards. I also developed some new projects like <strong>Bike & Body Fit</strong> and <strong>VDU posture monitor</strong> having to deal with <strong>media</strong> libraries, <strong>Computer Vision</strong> and <strong>Neural Networks</strong>.<br>
    I recently started using <code>Rust</code> in seek of a modern <code>C++</code> alternative, I rewrote some mathematical algorithms in <code>Rust</code> for Scanny3D and I'm currently working on <code>regui</code>, a crate to wrap other GUI libraries in rust in a reactive framework.
