I'm a **physics student** and a **software developer**. My main interests are **physics** and **programming**. I'm interested in physics because I like to understand how the world works and in programming because I like to create things and I like to solve problems, learning new things as I go.

I worked with many programming languages, especially `C++` and `Rust`.  
I developed many projects in `C++`, including a **Structured Light** 3d Scanner, many mathematical algorithms and a total rewrite of the Qt **Signal/Slot** system. I also applied my `C++` knowledge to some embedded systems, working with **ESP32**, **STM32**, **Raspberry** and **Arduino** boards. I also developed some new projects like **Bike & Body Fit** and **VDU posture monitor** having to deal with **media** libraries, **Computer Vision** and **Neural Networks**.  
I recently started using `Rust` in seek of a modern `C++` alternative, I rewrote some mathematical algorithms in `Rust` for Scanny3D and I'm currently working on `regui`, a crate to wrap other GUI libraries in rust in a reactive framework.
