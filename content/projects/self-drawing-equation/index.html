title: Self Drawing Equation

<h1>Self Drawing Equation</h1>

This was an old project I did in high school. <br>
The goals were:
<ol>
    <li>Have fun</li>
    <li>Create an 2D equation that draws itself on a cartesian plane</li>
</ol>

The way I tried to do this was to create a series of equations that would draw the alphabet, then compose them in "some way" to draw a self drawing equation.
